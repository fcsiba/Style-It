# Style-It
FYP Fall 2018:
This is our FYP app. This will basically be called an AR styling app. You would be able to
interact. The user will have the option to browse through several styles and colors
and choose one from them. After that, they can either save the style as a photo or even
share with their friends through social media.
# How to run?
Note: This is an Xcode 10 Project and will require an A12 Apple device to work.
To run this app simply open this project in Xcode 10 and run it with an A12 Device Emulator or an A12 device.

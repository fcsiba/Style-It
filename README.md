# Style-It
FYP Fall 2018:
This is our FYP app. This will basically be called an AR styling app as with the hairs, you would be able to
interact. The user will have the option to browse through several styles and colors
and choose one from them. After that, they can either save the style as a photo or even
share with their friends through social media.
#
Note: This is an Xcode 10 Project and will require an A12 Apple device to work.
